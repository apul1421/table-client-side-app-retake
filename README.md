# Django based E-commerce
Table is a cloud based restaurant ordering and order management system <br>

## How does it work ?

This is a web application optimised to run on mobile browser, As soon as a customer enters restaurant he will be prompted to share his location on the basis of location menu of restaurant at that coordinate will be shown to user where he can choose from variety of food items and order them from the web application sitting at his table without any need of waiter or billing counter. Finally the order could be paid online and the chef will receive the order on his dashboard where he can send push notifications regarding the ETA and order completion.
